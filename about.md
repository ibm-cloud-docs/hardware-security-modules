# About IBM Cloud HSM
{: #about-hsm}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} HSM provides dedicated, single-tenant encryption, key management, and storage that uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). An HSM is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing.  
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} personnel manage and monitor the health of the HSM appliance and operating environment, and don't have access to where your keys are stored. This separation of key and data management duties is for data security governance and regulatory alignment.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} HSM offers the following two Thales SafeNet Luna module options:

* Thales SafeNet Luna a750, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM 7.0 is FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified. With this certification, you can solve complex security, compliance, data sovereignty, and control challenges that are associated with migrating and running cloud-based workloads.
* Thales SafeNet Luna SA 7000, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM 6.0 is FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified for PKI, digital signatures, and cryptographic key storage.

Supported operating systems include AIX, Linux, Oracle Solaris, and Microsoft Windows.
